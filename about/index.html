				<p>Hello! My name is <span style="background-color: #DCD0FF">Rebecca Hsieh</span>, and this is a test run for this about me page. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I am currently a Software Engineer at <span style="background-color: #DCD0FF">Cisco</span>in the San Francisco Bay Area where I build a multicloud management platform writing cloud APIs and other backend shenanigans.
				<br>
				<br>
				When I'm not staring into the depths of my laptop screen or dancing to my Spotify playlist of the season, I practice yoga, run (when I have time and it's not sweltering hot), and explore the city life. 
				<br>
				<br>
				It is also a huge passion of mine to help and work with underprivileged girls that are interested in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics).

				Let's see how this page turns out!</p>
